BlueGel
=======

A library to help you develop Javascript-based Leap Motion apps. Blue gel: it [helps you jump](http://theportalwiki.com/wiki/Repulsion_Gel).

I'm just starting out with the Leap Motion, so  the shape of this library will fluctuate. Feel free to contribute ideas or code -- pull requests welcome!

Currently Implemented:
----------------------

* In development

Planned:
--------

* _Gesture analysis_: primary direction of movement, detection of ghost events
* _Firehose filter_: detect events matching specific parameters more easily, eliminating ghost or duplicate events

What else would be useful?
