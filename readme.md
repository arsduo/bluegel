BlueGel
=======

A library to help you develop Javascript-based Leap Motion apps. Blue gel: it [helps you jump](http://theportalwiki.com/wiki/Repulsion_Gel).

I'm just starting out with the Leap Motion, so  the shape of this library will fluctuate. Feel free to contribute ideas or code -- pull requests welcome!

Currently Implemented:
----------------------

* _Gesture analysis_: primary direction of movement
* _Gesture filter_: detect events matching specific parameters more easily, eliminating ghost or duplicate events


Planned:
--------

* _Additional filters_: drink from the firehose of frame events more easily
* _Additional analyzers_: more easily understand what's going on

What else would be useful?

In Action:
----------

Check out [LeapNoise](https://github.com/arsduo/leapnoise), a simple Leap
Motion app for controlling iTunes, to see BlueGel in action.
